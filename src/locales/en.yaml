  p1: >
    I'm an architect of large software systems, a passionate iOS developer with a focus on user experience, and like to lead by example.
  p2: >
    I started as an iOS dev at a mobile payment Startup, ran the iOS development at COBI.Bike, and was the responsible mobile architect at Bosch eBike. I've led a team as product owner and develop my own iOS app.
  p3: >
    Now I support companies as a freelancer.

      I have years of professional experience across many aspects of iOS development.
    p2: >
      Over the years, I gathered a deep knowledge of iOS development practices and frameworks. In collaboration with UX designers, I've implemented a variety of UI interfaces, from stock to custom.
    p3: >
      I've designed and implemented countless features, many deeply integrating with the OS and backend services. I was also regularly involved in building foundational frameworks for internal use.

    p1: >
      Via Bluetooth, I've integrated a variety of IoT devices with mobile platforms, from protocol design to implementation.
    p2: >
      Together with embedded developers, I've designed and implemented multiple binary protocols for Bluetooth communication. From transmitting high-frequency data via a message bus (across embedded C, iOS, Android & JavaScript) to transfers of large firmware updates.
    p3: >
      Over multiple years I've built up experience with the iOS CoreBlueooth stack, solving a lot of intricate problems to enable a seamless and fast user experience.

    p1: >
      I've designed and implemented architectures from feature-rich Startup apps to complex multi-team IoT products.
    p2: >
      I've designed and implemented app architectures at different scales. At the StartUp companies, enabling quick iteration was a major goal. At Bosch eBike, though, more than a handful of domain teams had to work on the mobile apps autonomously. In collaboration with the devs, I deployed a modular architecture to achieve that.
    p3: >
      As a system architect, I closely worked together with embedded and backend architects to create a coherent overarching architecture. Together with the leadership team, I also had the opportunity to shape the digital strategy of Bosch eBike from a technological perspective.
    p4: >
      Through this, I gathered many insights enabling me to have a very holistic perspective and approach to architecture.

      Leading and motivating people thrives me and I gathered a lot of experience in my various roles.
    p2: >
      As technical product owner of a team of six, I was covering the roles of team lead, technical owner, and project manager. I was responsible for setting the agenda and aligning it with other teams, overall product management, and system architecture (in my dual role as system architect).
    p3: >
      Most important for me was to have a happy and productive team. For that, we did regular retrospectives and I set up bi-weekly personal one-on-one meetings with all team members. Together with the disciplinary manager, I also ran the yearly goal-setting meetings.

    p1: >
      Privacy is important to me and I acquired expertise in how to design private, secure & compliant systems.
    p2: >
      Privacy needs to be part of every software design from the start. In my role as a system architect, in collaboration with the legal team, I've designed systems that minimized data usage and made data flows transparent and controllable. This was not only to the benefit of the user but also provided legal confidence (GDPR compliance) and reduced manual processes.
    p3: >
      I've also designed multiple high-level security mechanisms that were validated by security experts to control access and ensure authenticity.

      In my role as mobile and system architect for eBike Digital, I set up and evolved the <a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/the-smart-system" target="_blank">smart system</a> digital platform. Later, I also became product owner and lead a team building an internal foundation layer (SDK) for the <a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/ebike-flow-app" target="_blank">Flow app</a>. In these roles, I gathered a lot of leadership experience and was on the way to a formal lead position.
    p1: >
      The Flow app is at the center of the <a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/the-smart-system" target="_blank">smart system</a> generation of Bosch eBike. eBike configuration and maintenance, component firmware updates, lock & alarm, route planning and navigation, ride screen with fitness sensors, activity tracking, 3rd party integrations, and more. It is available in many languages and well received on the app stores.
    p2: >
      I was able to play a significant role in the development of the Bosch eBike  <a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/the-smart-system" target="_blank">smart system</a> generation from the very beginning. Together with the most experienced software architects at Bosch eBike, I laid the technical foundations for the interaction of the hardware and software components. I was able to use my experience in digital product development, BLE, communication protocols, and data models.
    p3: >
      At the same time, as a system architect at eBike Digital, I had the main technical responsibility for the development of the Flow App for iOS and Android. With developers from three locations, I started the project from scratch, made important technology decisions collaboratively, and created the architectural basis for the simultaneous development across more than a handful of mobile dev teams.
    p4: >
      In collaboration with the other system architects, I significantly shaped the technological and architectural landscape of Bosch eBike over the years. Especially in data modeling and automated data privacy processes.
    p5: >
      After the initial set-up phase, I also took over a team as technical product owner and team lead. As a mobile platform team, we created important foundational components to enable the effective product development of the other teams. Just one year later, the team was well recognized and created some of eBike Digital's most important assets.
    p6: >
      In the team, I was responsible for planning the project and representing it to other teams and management. I established an effective Kanban work mode, which was also adopted by other teams. In bi-weekly coaching sessions with the team members, I ensured their well-being and development and supported official goal-setting meetings.
    p7: >
      I was also involved in the recruiting process and was participating in a leadership program to take on a formal leadership role at Bosch.

      The <a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/cobibike-app" target="_blank">COBI.Bike</a> Startup transformed bicycles into smart bikes. As developer and later iOS lead I implemented major parts of the iOS app and evolved its architecture. At COBI, I also wrote my thesis about utilizing code generation for BLE communication wrapping up my <span class="icontext"><i class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap"></i> Bachelor</span>.
    p1: >
      COBI.Bike is turning every bike into a connected one. The Bluetooth-enabled bike accessory sits on the handlebar, charges the phone, gives you control over the app via thumb controller, and interconnects with the eBike systems. The heart of COBI are the mobile apps. Riding dashboard, navigation, fitness tracking (with BLE sensors & Apple Watch), HealthKit, Strava & Komoot integration, music and call controls, and much more.
    p2: >
      I joined the COBI Start Up as a student intern and later took over as iOS lead and architect. I worked on all parts of the app. From the lovely animated user interface, over maps and routing, the many iOS and 3rd party integrations to the extensive Bluetooth communication.
    p3: >
      I very much enjoyed the autonomy typical for an early-stage StartUp. I used it to constantly iterate on the iOS app architecture, tools, and practices. My bachelor thesis very much simplified Bluetooth communication by modeling the transmitted data and generating code for all involved platforms.
