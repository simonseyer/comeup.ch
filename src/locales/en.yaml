      I've integrated a variety of BLE devices with mobile platforms, from protocol design to implementation.
    p2: >
      In close collaboration with embedded developers, I've designed and implemented multiple binary protocols for Bluetooth communication, transparently transmitting high-frequency data via a message bus across multiple platforms (Embedded C, iOS, Android & JavaScript) and enabling transfers of large data like firmware updates.
    p3: >
      I've also got multiple years of experience working with the iOS CoreBlueooth stack, solving a lot of intricate problems to enable a seamless and fast experience when interacting with IoT devices.

    p1: >
      My architecture designs drive innovation from feature-rich Startup apps to complex multi-team IoT products.
    p2: >
      I've designed and implemented app architectures at all scales. From enabling quick iteration in a feature-rich iOS App developed by a three-person Startup team (me included) to collaboratively crafting a modular architecture from scratch that enabled more than a handful of domain teams to work on an Android and iOS app largely in autonomy.
    p3: >
      As a system architect, I closely worked together with embedded and backend architects and many teams to create a coherent overall architecture. This gave me many insights and allows me to have a very holistic approach to architecture.
    p4: >
      To improve shared understanding and drive communication protocols as well as privacy measures, I've developed domain specific languages to describe domains that became one of the most central pieces of technology at Bosch eBike.

    p1: >
      As a system architect, technical product owner and team lead I learned how to motivate and grow people.
    p2: >
      As technical product owner of a team of six, I was covering the roles of team lead, technical owner, and project manager. I was responsible for setting the agenda, aligning it with other teams, overall product management, and the system architecture (in my dual role as system architect).
    p3: >
      Most important for me was to have a happy and productive team. For that, we did regular retrospectives and I decided to do personal one-on-one meetings with all team members every one or two weeks. In collaboration with the disciplinary manager, I also ran the yearly goal-setting meetings.

      Automating mobile testing and delivery is key for productivity — I've done it across many projects.
    p2: >
      From a simple iOS app deployment pipeline to complex mobile testing and delivery systems including large and modular projects, complex versioning, multiple deployment levels, and requirements like open-source scanning, I've designed and managed several systems as a developer as well as a team lead.
    p3: >
      This enabled teams to move fast without breaking things, provided quick feedback, enabled regular releases, and ensured transparency (for efficiency as well as compliance reasons). At some point, dozens of developers relied on the system for daily work.

    p1: >
      I know how to design systems that are private and secure without impacting productivity.
    p2: >
      Privacy needs to be by design. In my role as a system architect, in constant collaboration with the legal team, I've designed systems that minimized data usage and designed sophisticated ways to make data flow transparent and controllable. This was not only to the benefit of the user but also gave us more legal confidence (e.g. GDPR compliance) and limited manual processes.
    p3: >
      I also designed multiple high-level security mechanisms to control access and ensure authenticity, mostly utilizing asymmetric cryptography, that were validated by security experts.

    summary: >
      As responsible mobile and system architect for eBike Digital, I was trusted with setting up and evolving the <a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/the-smart-system" target="_blank">smart system</a> digital platform. As product owner, I also lead a team that built a technical foundation (SDK) for internal use. I coached my team members and was on the way to a leadership position.
    p1: >
      The Flow app is at the center of the <a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/the-smart-system" target="_blank">smart system</a> generation of Bosch eBike (market leader for eBike systems). eBike configuration and maintenance, component firmware updates, lock & alarm, route planning and navigation, ride screen with fitness sensors, activity tracking, 3rd party integrations, and more. Well-designed and available in many languages, it is very popular with its users.
    p2: >
      I was able to play a significant role in the development of the Bosch eBike  <a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/the-smart-system" target="_blank">smart system</a> generation from the very beginning. Together with the most experienced software architects at Bosch eBike, I laid the technical foundations for the interaction of the hardware and software components. I was able to use my experience in digital product development, Bluetooth, communication protocols, and data models.
    p3: >
      At the same time, as a system architect at eBike Digital, I had the main technical responsibility for the development of the Flow App for iOS and Android. With developers from three locations, I started the project from scratch, defined the framework for the software development, made important technology decisions collaboratively, and created the architectural basis for the parallel development of the app across more than a handful of mobile development teams.
    p4: >
      In collaboration with the other system architects, I significantly shaped the technological and architectural landscape of Bosch eBike. Especially in data modeling and automated data privacy processes.
    p5: >
      I then took over a team as technical product owner and team lead. As a mobile platform team, we created an important technical platform to enable the effective product development of the other teams. Just one year later, the team was well recognized and created some of eBike Digital's most important assets.
    p6: >
      In the team, I was responsible for planning the project and representing it to other teams and management. I established an effective Kanban work mode, which was also adopted by other teams. In weekly coaching sessions with the team members, I ensured their well-being and development and supported official goal-setting meetings.
    p7: >
      I was also involved in the application process and was on my way to officially take on leadership responsibilities at Bosch.

      The <a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/cobibike-app" target="_blank">COBI.Bike</a> Startup kicked off the digitalization of the bicycle. As a developer and later iOS lead I architected and implemented major parts of the iOS app. I also wrapped up my <span class="icontext"><i class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap"></i> Bachelor</span> with a thesis about utilizing code generation for BLE communication.
    p1: >
      COBI.Bike is turning every bike into a connected one. The Bluetooth-enabled bike accessory sits on the handlebar, charges the phone, gives you control over the app via thumb controller, and interconnects with the eBike system (if available).
    p2: >
      The heart of COBI are the mobile apps. Riding dashboard, navigation, fitness tracking (including data from BLE sensors & Apple Watch), HealthKit, Strava & Komoot integration, music and call controls, and much more.
    p3: >
      I joined the COBI Start Up as a student intern and later took over as development iOS lead and architect. I worked on all parts of the app, from the highly custom and lovely animated user interface, over mapping and navigation, the many iOS and 3rd party integrations to the extensive Bluetooth communication (including a model-based cross-platform code generation solution — the topic of my Bachelor thesis).
