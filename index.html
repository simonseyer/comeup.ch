                With many years of experience, I have a deep knowledge of iOS development practices and frameworks. In
                collaboration with UX designers I've implemented a variety of UI interfaces, from stock to custom.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've designed and implemented countless features, many deeply integrating with the OS and backend
                services. I was also regularly involved in building foundational frameworks for internal use.

                In close collaboration with embedded developers, I've designed and implemented multiple binary protocols
                for Bluetooth communication, transparently transmitting high frequency data via a message bus across
                multiple platforms (Embedded C, iOS, Android & JavaScript) and enabling transfers of large data like
                firmware updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've also got multiple years of experience working with the iOS CoreBlueooth stack, solving a lot of
                intracte problems to enable a seamless and fast experience when interacting with IoT devices.

                I've designed and implemented app architectures at all scales. From enabling quick iteration in a
                feature rich iOS App developed by a three-person StartUp team (me included) to collaboratively crafting
                a modular architecture from scratch that enabled more than a handfull of domain-teams working on an
                Android and iOS app largely in autonomony.
              </p>
              <p>
                As system architect, I closely worked together with embedded and backend architects and many teams to
                create a coherent overall architecture. This gave me many insights and allows me to have a very holistic
                approach to architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                To improve shared understanding and drive communication protocols as well as privacy measures, I've
                developed domain specific languages to describe domains that became one of the most central piece of
                technology at Bosch eBike.

                Most important for me was to have a happy and productive team. For that, we did regular retrospectives

              <p>
                This enabled teams to move fast without breaking things, provided quick feedback, enabled regular

                Privacy needs to be by design. In my role as system architect, in constant collaboration with the legal
                team, I've designed systems that minimised data usage and designed sophisticated ways to make data flows
                transparent and controllable. This was not only to the benefit of the user but also gave us more legal
                confidence (e.g. GDPR compliance) and limited manual processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also designed multiple high level security mechanisms to control access and ensure authenticity,
                mostly utilising asymmetric cryptography, that were validated by security experts.

                eBike. eBike configuration and maintenance, component firmware updates, lock & alarm, route planning and
                navigation, ride screen with fitness sensors, activity tracking, 3rd party integrations and more. Well
                designed and available in many languages, it is very popular with its users.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was able to play a significant role in the development of the Bosch eBike 'smart system' generation
                from the very beginning. Together with the most experienced software architects at Bosch eBike, I laid
                the technical foundations for the interaction of the hardware and software components. I was able to use
                my experience in digital product development, Bluetooth, communication protocols and data models.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, as a system architect at eBike Digital, I had the main technical responsibility for
                the development of the Flow App for iOS and Android. With developers from three locations, I started the
                project from scratch, defined the framework for the software development, made important technology
                decisions collaboratively and created the architectural basis for the parallel development of the app
                across more than a handful of mobile development teams.
              </p>
              <p>
                In collaboration with the other system architects, I significantly shaped the technological and
                architectural landscape of Bosch eBike over the years. Especially in data modelling and automated data
                privacy processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2021, I was allowed to take over a team as technical product owner and team lead. As a mobile
                platform team, we created an important technical platform to enable the effective product development of
                the other teams in the first place. In 2022, the team is more than recognised and creates some of eBike
                Digital's most important assets.

                In the team, I was responsible for planning the project and representing it to other teams and
                management. I established an effective Kanban work mode, which was also adopted by other teams. In
                weekly coaching sessions with the team members, I ensured their well-being and development and supported
                official goal-setting meetings.

                I was also involved in the application process and was on my way to officially taking on leadership
                responsibilities at Bosch.

                Paraquip is an iOS app for paragliding pilots to manage their equipment. It tracks the check history and
                notifies about upcoming checks. For safety and performance, it calculates wing loading.

                COBI.Bike is turning every bike into a connected one. The Bluetooth enabled bike accessory sits on the
                handlebar, charges the phone, allows to control the app via thumb controller and interconnects with the
                eBike system (if available).

                The heart of COBI are the mobile apps. Riding dashboard, navigation, fitness tracking (including data
                from BLE sensors & Apple Watch), HealthKit, Strava & Komoot integration, music and call controls, and
                much more.

                I've joined the COBI Start Up as student intern and later took over as development iOS lead and
                architect. I worked on basically all parts of the app, from the highly custom and lovely animated user
                interface, over mapping and navigation, the many iOS and 3rd party integrations to the extensive
                Bluetooth communication.
